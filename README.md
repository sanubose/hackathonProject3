# Problem Statement

## **Local Democracy Engagement Platform**

Create a system that makes local government accessible and impactful:

- Real-time notifications about issues affecting your specific neighborhood
- Plain language summaries of proposed local legislation
- Direct feedback channels to representatives with public response tracking
- Community voting features that aggregate constituent opinions
- Impact visualization showing how policies affect different community segments
- Organizing tools for neighborhood initiatives

This addresses declining civic engagement by making local democracy tangible and accessible.
